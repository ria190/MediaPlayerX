We designed and implemented a user-friendly, platform-independent media player which can play most audio files like .mp3, .wav and video files like .mp4.
We used JavaFx and Scene Builder for creating this project. It can play only some restricted audio and video files like .mp3, .wav, .mp4 because of the limitations of JavaFx. 

To run the file, we used VsCode. Download extension pack for java on VsCode. 
Install JavaFx SDK (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ ) of suitable version and OS( preferred windows). Set reference libraries in vscode ((eg. openjfx-17.0.9_windows-x64_bin-sdk)> lib ). 
Click on run and Debug.
